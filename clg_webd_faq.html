    <div class="intro">
      <p><b> Looking for answers? </b></p>

    <p> Someone once said, “He who has all the answers isn’t asking the right questions.”
      We like to think we have both! <br><br>
        Here are some helpful answers to questions we get all the time. Want to talk in person?

     <h2> <u>About us (in general)</u> </h2> <br>

     <div class="ques"><p> What is CharitAble India? </p></div>
     <p> We are a global non-profit organisation for the betterment of children which was founded in January,
       2020 in India. Today, it is working alongside India's leading independent child rights NGOs. As of now,
       we plan to cover all 29 states of India. For further details, visit <a href="clg_webd_about.html">About</a>.</p>

     <div class="ques"><p> What do you work for? </p></div>
     <p>Our kids. Half the kids in the world (about a billion) are growing up in poverty. And while global
       poverty is a huge and complex problem, it's also solvable. In fact, we've got a bold plan to help.
       For more details, visit our <a href="clg_webd_home.html">home page</a>.</p>

     <div class="ques"><p> How did you get started? </p></div>
     <p> A group of like minded people originally working for betterment of children at their own levels came
       together to broaden the field of work with the belief of <em> together we can.</em></p>

     <div class="ques"><p> How can I work at your organisation? </p></div>
     <p> We’re looking for the best, brightest and most passionate people on the planet. <a href="clg_webd_join.html">Join Us</a>.</p>
     <br><br>

     <h2> <u>About giving (including where your money goes)</u> </h2> <br>

     <div class="ques"><p> Where does my money actually go? Do you give it directly to the kids in your program? </p></div>
     <p> No, we don’t give funds directly to the kids, but your support is invested directly into programs
       for their health, education, empowerment and employment. </p>

     <div class="ques"><p> In what different ways can I contribute? </p></div>
     <p> You can either <a href="clg_webd_donate.html">donate</a> or <a href="clg_webd_join.html">join us</a>.
       If you want to contribute in any way other than financial, <a href="clg_webd_contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>

     <div class="ques"><p> How do you choose locations to build a community center? </p></div>
     <p> We look at areas with the highest concentration of poverty, usually urban slum communities. Using government data
       and statistics, we identify major cities and then seek to understand what the need is and what other services are
       offered in those communities. </p>

     <div class="ques"><p> What is your refund/cancellation policy? </p></div>
     <p> If for any reason you would like a refund for your donation, we will process the refund, using the original
       method of payment. It may take up to 10 business days (depending on your bank) for a refund to appear on your account.
        You can cancel your monthly subscription anytime by <a href="clg_webd_contact.html">contacting us</a>.</p><br>
