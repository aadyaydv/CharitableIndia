    <h1 align="center"> About us </h1> <br><br>

    <div class="intro">
    <p> We are a global non-profit organisation which was founded in January, 2020 in India.
      Today, it is working alongside India's leading independent child rights NGOs. As of now,
      we plan to cover all 29 states of India. <br><br>

    CharitAble India believes that every child deserves the best chance for a bright future and
    that’s why we are fiercely committed towards ensuring that children not only survive, but thrive.
    We run programmes in the remotest corners of India and urban areas to provide quality education and
    healthcare, protection from harm and abuse and life-saving aid during emergencies to children.
    Globally, CharitAble is present in more than 80 countries and works to improve the lives of the most
    vulnerable children living there. <br><br>

    Children are our most valuable assets and deserve all the support and protection we can provide them.
    Bold in our ambition and powerful in our care, we do whatever it takes to save the world’s children. <br><br>

    In India and around the world, CharitAble India is on the ground – every day and in times of crisis.
    Our pioneering programmes address children’s unique needs, giving them a healthy start, the opportunity
    to learn and protection from harm. When crisis strikes, we are always among the first to respond and the
    last to leave. We are outspoken champions for children, ensuring their voices are heard and their issues
    are given top priority. Drawing on a century of leading expertise, we take on the toughest challenges facing
    the hardest-to-reach children – especially those unfairly excluded from the world’s progress. <br><br>

    We are proud to be the world’s leading expert on children, delivering lasting results for millions of vulnerable
    girls and boys. By saving the world’s children, we transform their lives and the future we share.
    Child Labour, Child Refugee Crisis, Child Trafficking, Improper Healthcare and Lack of Education are our prime enemies,
    all of which stem from Poverty. </p>

    <p> We firmly believe that <em>'together we can'</em>. So come <a href="clg_webd_join.html">join us</a>! </p>
